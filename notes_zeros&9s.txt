ZEROS AND NINES THOUGHT PROCESS 

Write a class ZerosAndNines that asks the user to input an integer n, 
and then (using a queue) calculates and prints the least positive 
integer x that is a multiple of n and whose digits are only zeros or nines.

9
90 => 9 + 0
99 => 9 + 9
900 => 90 + 0
909 => 90 + 9
990 => 99 + 0
...

Like binary counting, but swap 1 for 9

While loop
Check if each one is divisible by n. 
Print if true.

Check for edge case if n = 0 or if n is prime

Seems like bad time complexity.../slow -> more efficient how?
